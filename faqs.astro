    <h2>How does TeleMedVisits protect my privacy?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We are committed to protecting privacy of every individual who uses our services. We comply with all relevant state, national, and international laws and regulations.</li>
      <li>This includes the United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, known as <strong>HIPAA</strong>. Unless permitted or required by law, your medical information will not be shared without your consent.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="prescriptions" style="margin-top:1rem;">
    <h2>What about prescriptions?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>TeleMedVisits does not guarantee a prescription for every visit. It is up to the provider to recommend the best available treatment options. TMV providers <strong>DO NOT ISSUE</strong> prescriptions for substances controlled by the DEA, non‑therapeutic and/or certain other drugs that may be harmful because of their potential for abuse. Also, non‑therapeutic drugs such as Viagra and Cialis are not prescribed by TMV providers.</li>
      <li>If the provider prescribes medication, it is submitted electronically or by phone to the pharmacy of your choice in the state of Florida. We cannot send prescriptions out of the state of Florida. Stay tuned for future expansion!</li>
      <li>We suggest contacting your selected pharmacy to confirm when your prescription will be ready. If for some reason there is an error, please reach out to us. We are not responsible for lost medications once picked up at the pharmacy. We do not issue refills beyond the date of service.</li>
    </ul>
